UPDATE LOG:

-------------------
v2 - Aug 2, 2022
-------------------

GENERAL:
- Increased default size by a few pixels.
- Increased outline width.
- Animation polishes; animations are now faster and snappier.
- Added 30+ new bonus cursors.
- Added new color variations: Matte Gray, and Jet Black. The default white is now named Paper White.
- A "Loop" variations are now available for select states.
- A "Pointing Hand" variation for the link select is now available.
- Kami is now available in "Regular" and "HD" size variation. Use HD if you have a HiDPI monitors.
- Kami is also now available in 32 and 48 px format. 32px is the default for 100%-125% Windows display scale, and 48px for beyond 150%.
- Updated the installer file (.inf). Now it will also copy the "Bonus Cursors" folder in the installation directory (C:\Windows\Cursors). No need to do it manually.
- Reduced pause time with states with a short pause at the end of animations.
- Shortened cursors and folder names to prevent errors concerning Windows "File location" character limit. These errors usually make some cursor file unselectable or the thumbnails not loading in the File Explorer.
- Due to Windows' 1809 update bug still unpatched by Microsoft, the default "Normal" is temporarily set to a non-animated (.cur) variation to prevent the bug. The classic animated is still available inside the "Bonus Cursors" folder. Alternatively, if you want all of the states to be animated, use the new "Loop" variations inside the Bonus Cursors folder.
